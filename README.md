### HOW TO USE

1. Obtain source ROM.
2. Use the BPS patch file from the current release to patch your ROM. I recommend FLIPS.
3. Download the SoundPacks and make sure the rom and cue files have identical base-filenames (eg. game.md and game.cue)
4. Make sure all files are in the same folder
5. If using an emulator, make sure you are using the correct CD bios files!
